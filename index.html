    <h1>The Reconstruction Period and Labs</h1>
   	<p>The goals for Reconstruction were primarily to rebuild the South through diversifying  the economy, and giving former slaves freedom, rights and equal opportunities.  These seem like simple enough tasks, but carrying them out was not easy and did not seem to completely work out for all Americans.  The White landowners took advantage of the newly freed Blacks and gave them a taste of what freedom would have been but did not actually give them all they wanted or deserved.  Instead of getting actual freedom they were stuck in a constant bondage that they could not get out of, and they were paralyzed in a constant state of fear by harassment of white supremacists.  The Black community ended up mostly in the South with nothing besides their families, debt, being taken advantage of, and lack of upward mobility.
